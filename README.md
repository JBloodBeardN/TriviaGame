# TriviaGame

this is a project for UT coding bootcamp. 
it explores timing events and updating the dom with javascript and jquery

to fulfill the need for questions I used a well-recognized scene from Monte Python's the Holy Grail. 
Try using correct answers (as answered in the movie), incorrect answers, and letting a timer expire. 
You can also reset the game and play again. 
Have fun!
